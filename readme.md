# Convertedin Taxonomy service
Google taxonomy search service

# Usage
- Make sure you installed `swoole extension`
- clone this repo
- Open your terminal and write `php public/index.php`, after that the service will be available on `port 8080`
- If you want to change the port go to `bootstrap/app.php` and edit the port.

## Important
Any edit on the code you need to restart the server.

If you run the service with supervisor you need to restart it, if you don't do this the changes will not appear.
